# Python Solutions to *Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition*

This is a **Python** solutions for the book [Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition](https://www.careercup.com/book) by *Gayle Laakmann McDowell*.

## How to use?

To run the programs, just use the `python ChapterX/filename.py` command.

The test cases are included in the solution files.

## Contributions

Contributions welcome! Please provide solutions compatible with python 3 and include test cases.

In general solutions should fall into one of the following three categories:
 - *algorithm demonstration*.  This is the primary type of problem and solution that the text is concerned with. As
 such, solutions should not use standard library functions in cases that would make it unnecessary to implement the
 algorithm.  The goal of these solutions should be to have an easy to understand solution that demonstrates
 understanding of the algorithm.
 - *python demonstration*.  We also accept solutions that solve the problem in a more practical way, using whatever
 standard library functions are available.  Please do not use any third party dependencies.  These solutions should
 also be easy to understand and good examples of pythonic ways of doing things.
 - *speed demonstration*.  These alternative solutions may be accepted if the fastest way to do something is not very
 readable or intuitive and thus it doesn't fit into the first two categories.
